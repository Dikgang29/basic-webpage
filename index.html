        I have always wanted to go to Cape Town because its a beautiful city witha alot of sightseeing.
        While there i could visit Robben Island and see the prison cell of the former president of South Africa  president Nelson Mandela and learn amore about what happend during this imprisonment.
        Again I have always wanted to vist Table Mountain because it is one of the most talked about landmarks in South Africa and apparently it has the best view of Cape Town. The best wineries in the country are in Cape Town, I would like to visit there and see how wine is made.
        I believe there are alot of activities that side, that's why it is the city I would like to visit.

          and is about the same size as Wales. Firstly, did you know that the
          Kruger National Park is the largest game reserves in Africa? It spans
          across 19,633 square kilometers. That's just smaller than the size of

          27,000 African Buffalo, 2,000 leopards and 2,800 lions. It's also
          regarded as the best place in the world to see a leopard.
